Finished the first exercise of the couse Neural network. 

The exercise was to code logistic regression using a neural network from scratch. The goal of this exercise was to get familiar with neural networks. 
Their structure and architecture and the mathematics involved. 

It also served the purpose of understanding how to imporve the algorithm using hyperparameters. And also how to visualize data, performance of the algorithm.
